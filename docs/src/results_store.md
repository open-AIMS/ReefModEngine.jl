# Results

Reefmod Engine outputs and scenario information are recorded from the ReefMod Engine API
after each scenario(s) run, not before.

## Result Store

The result stores holds all model outputs from both counterfactual and interventions.
Information about scenarios is stored in the scenario field of the result store. The reps
field the result store is exactly have the number of scenarios contained in the scenario
Dataframe and result YAX Dataset holdering outcomes. This is because the API forces counterfactual to be
evaluated with every intervention run.

Model inputs are stored in the `results` field of the store and contains the following
variables:

 - `total_cover`      ~ Total Coral Cover (% of total reef area)
 - `dhw`              ~ Degree Heating Weeks (Â°C weeks)
 - `dhw_mortality`    ~ DHW Mortality (% of population*)
 - `cyc_mortality`    ~ Cyclone Mortality (% of population*)
 - `cyc_cat`          ~ Cyclone Category
 - `cots`             ~ COTS Population (per ha)
 - `cots_mortality`   ~ Mortality caused by COTS (% of population*)
 - `total_taxa_cover` ~ Total Species Cover (% of total reef area)

## Usage

A side effect of the C++ API structure means that each intervention scenario must be
executed separately (**Intervention scenario** meaning a run with a specific intervention
strategy, not referring to runs with differing environmental inputs called repeats).

1. Before storing any results, create the result store.

```julia
result_store = ResultStore(start_year, end_year)
```
2. Perform model run

```julia
...

```

3. Store results

`reps` is the number of repeats executed in the run.

```julia
concat_results!(result_store, start_year, end_year, reps)
```

## Saving Results

Results can be saved using `save_result_store`.
```julia
save_result_store(<dir_name>, <result_store>)
```

The results directory will contain two files `results.nc` and `scenarios.csv`.

The NetCDF file contains all the model inputs and outputs described above and the scenarios
csv file details the intervention parameters used in the model runs and is in the same order
as the scenario dimension in the netcdf fie.

::: warning

If there is already a scenarios Dataframe in the directory being saved to it will
be overwritten
